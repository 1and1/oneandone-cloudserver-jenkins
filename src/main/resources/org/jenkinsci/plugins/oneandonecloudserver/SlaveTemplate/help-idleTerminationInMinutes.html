<div>
    Determines how long slaves can remain idle before being terminated - that
    is the server being destroyed.

    <P>
    Times are expressed in minutes, and a value of 0 indicates that idle slaves
    should never be terminated.

    <P>
    As Jenkins doesn't check the idle status of slaves every minute even if you
    tell it to (it might skip checks for a few minutes), Jenkins might
    terminate the slave a few minutes late of what you specify in this field.
